1. Wait for an HTTP post from PayPal.
2. Create a request that contains exactly the same IPN variables and values in the same order, preceded with cmd=_notify-validate.
3. Post the request to www.paypal.com or www.sandbox.paypal.com, depending on whether you are going live or testing your listener in the Sandbox.
4. Wait for a response from PayPal, which is either VERIFIED or INVALID.
5. Verify that the response status is 200.
6. If the response is VERIFIED, perform the following checks:
    - Confirm that the payment status is Completed.
        PayPal sends IPN messages for pending and denied payments as well; do not ship until the payment has cleared.
    - Use the transaction ID to verify that the transaction has not already been processed, which prevents duplicate transactions from being processed.
        Typically, you store transaction IDs in a database so that you know you are only processing unique transactions.
    - Validate that the receiverâ€™s email address is registered to you.
        This check provides additional protection against fraud.
    - Verify that the price, item description, and so on, match the transaction on your website.
        This check provides additional protection against fraud.
7. If the verified response passes the checks, take action based on the value of the txn_type variable if it exists; otherwise, take action based on the value of the reason_code variable.
8. If the response is INVALID or the response code is not 200, save the message for further investigation.
